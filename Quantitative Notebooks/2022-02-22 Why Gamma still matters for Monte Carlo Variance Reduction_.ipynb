The mathematic notation and examples are from Les Clewlow and Chris Strickland's book Implementing Derivatives Models.\n","\n","Unfortunately, although a great method for approximating option values with complex payoffs or high dimensionality, in order to get an acceptably accurate estimate we must perform a large number of simulations M. Instead we can lean on Variance Reduction methods which work on the same principles as that of hedging an option position. i.e. the variability of a hedged option portfolio will have a smaller variance that that of it's unhedged counterpart."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Cjfyqs-uSLBx","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1645497362034,"user_tz":-600,"elapsed":11265,"user":{"displayName":"Jonathon Emerick","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Giq9xEw4DhtJYHMD-QFk9rivPfE8jUcWMAkBjHx=s64","userId":"16629380951441395759"}},"outputId":"5c34476a-54b4-4af9-c62c-4eff2fade036"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Collecting py_vollib\n","  Downloading py_vollib-1.0.1.tar.gz (19 kB)\n","Collecting py_lets_be_rational\n","  Downloading py_lets_be_rational-1.0.1.tar.gz (18 kB)\n","Collecting simplejson\n","  Downloading simplejson-3.17.6-cp37-cp37m-manylinux_2_5_x86_64.manylinux1_x86_64.manylinux_2_12_x86_64.manylinux2010_x86_64.whl (130 kB)\n","\u001b[K     |████████████████████████████████| 130 kB 6.1 MB/s \n","\u001b[?25hRequirement already satisfied: numpy in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from py_vollib) (1.21.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pandas in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from py_vollib) (1.3.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: scipy in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from py_vollib) (1.4.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pytz>=2017.3 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from pandas->py_vollib) (2018.9)\n","Requirement already satisfied: python-dateutil>=2.7.3 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from pandas->py_vollib) (2.8.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: six>=1.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages (from python-dateutil>=2.7.3->pandas->py_vollib) (1.15.0)\n","Building wheels for collected packages: py-vollib, py-lets-be-rational\n","  Building wheel for py-vollib (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Created wheel for py-vollib: filename=py_vollib-1.0.1-py3-none-any.whl size=62855 sha256=80b61225528da9b0d423ee75c1a54ee205612d582d6db8ae5139fdd1b9c03ce0\n","  Stored in directory: /root/.cache/pip/wheels/2d/25/50/bc80b93c9a827ed9bef9d86f85365e1934bcbc0666b9f00c11\n","  Building wheel for py-lets-be-rational (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Created wheel for py-lets-be-rational: filename=py_lets_be_rational-1.0.1-py3-none-any.whl size=24468 sha256=d510b71aceeb62d261ebd29f6762ceab73ae0d4f86012aede8fb2d8168fefc2b\n","  Stored in directory: /root/.cache/pip/wheels/1a/70/10/bf54a16badc528594c9510ef517badb765a29b651ea5652898\n","Successfully built py-vollib py-lets-be-rational\n","Installing collected packages: simplejson, py-lets-be-rational, py-vollib\n","Successfully installed py-lets-be-rational-1.0.1 py-vollib-1.0.1 simplejson-3.17.6\n"]}],"source":["## This is required for google colab\n","!pip install py_vollib"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"urIwLnbeSLBz"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import dependencies\n","import time\n","import math\n","import datetime\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import scipy.stats as stats\n","from py_vollib.black_scholes import black_scholes as bs"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CxCf3xqXSLBz"},"source":["## General Control Variate Equation\n","\n","For J control variates we have:\n","\n","$ \\Large C_0\\exp(rT) = C_T - \\sum^J_{i=j}\\beta_j cv_j + \\eta$\n","\n","where\n","- $\\beta_j$ are factors to account for the \"true\" linear relationship between the option pay-off and the control variate $cv_j$\n","- $\\eta$ accounts for errors:\n","    - discrete rebalancing\n","    - approximations in hedge sensitivities (calc. delta / gamma)\n","    \n","    \n","Option price as the sum of the linear relationships with J control variates\n","    \n","$ \\large C_T =\\beta_0 + \\sum^J_{i=j}\\beta_j cv_j + \\eta$\n","\n","where $\\beta_0 = C_0\\exp(rT)$ is the forward price of the option\n","\n","If we perform M simulations at discrete time intervals N we can regard the pay-offs and control variates as samples of the linear relationship with some noise.
