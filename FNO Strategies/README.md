# Options-Trading-Strategies-in-Python

I have Created code for Options Trading based on Various Trading Technical Indicators.

1. Volatility Index (VIX) based Strategy
2. Put / Call Ratio (PCR) based Strategy
3. Trading Index (TRIN) based Strategy
4. Turtle Trading based Strategy
5. Monte Carlo Option Pricing in C++

Still working on more advanced Strategies based on **Black Scholes Merton Option Pricing**. Next I will work on incorporating **Time Series** and **Neural Networks** (RNNs to be specific) to improve accuraacy (Decrease Standard Deviation from current models) and Perfomance.  

**LSTMs** have gave me promosing results and now I am exploring advance LSTM like MD-LSTM and MiD-LSTM for better prediction and more feature inclusion.
