# Financial Modeling

### What is financial modeling?

Financial modeling is the task of building an abstract representation (a model) of a real world financial situation.

## Model 1 : Amortization Schedule

An amortization schedule is a complete table of periodic loan payments, showing the amount of principal and the amount of interest that comprise each payment until the loan is paid off at the end of its term. 

### Components of a Amortization Schedule in a Financial Model

#### Loan amount

Original or expected balance for your mortgage/loan.

#### Term in years

The number of years over which you will repay this loan.

#### Interest rate

Annual fixed interest rate for this loan. 

#### Payment per period

Includes principal payment and interest payment (PI).
While each periodic payment is the same amount early in the schedule, the majority of each payment is interest; later in the schedule, the majority of each payment covers the loan's principal. 

#### Total interest

Total of all interest paid over the full term of the mortgage. This total interest amount assumes that there are no prepayments of principal.

#### Total payments

Total of all monthly payments over the full term of the mortgage. This total payment amount assumes that there are no prepayments of principal.
