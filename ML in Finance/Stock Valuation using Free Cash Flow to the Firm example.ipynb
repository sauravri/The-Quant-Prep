    "In stock valuation models, there are three predominant definitions of future cash flows: dividends, free cash flows, and residual income.  We will focus on building a free cash flow model for stock valuation in this article.  Let's discuss the advantages and disadvantages of free cash flow valuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of free cash flow models is that they can be applied to many firms, regardless of dividend policies or capital structures.  The ability to influence the distribution and application of a firm's free cash flow makes these models more pertinent to a firm's controlling shareholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are cases in which the application of a free cash flow model may be very difficult.  Firms that have significant capital requirements may have negative free cash flow for many years into the future.  This can be caused by a technological revolution in an industry that requires greater investment to remain competitive or by rapid expansion into untapped markets.  This negative free cash flow complicates the cash flow forecast and makes the estimates less reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Free cash flow models are most appropriate:\n",
    "* For firms that do not have a dividend payment history or have a dividend payment history that is not clearly and appropriately related to earnings.\n",
    "* For firms with free cash flow that corresponds with their profitability.\n",
    "* When the valuation perspective is that of a controlling shareholder.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build our free cash flow model in three steps.  First, we will calculate the Free Cash Flow to the Firm.  Second, we will determine the Weighted Average Cost of Capital.  Finally, we will perform Stock Valuation using these inputs."

    "Forget about all the complicated financial statement relationships for a minute and simply picture the firm as a cash \"processor.\"  Cash flows into the firm in the form of revenue as it sells its product, and cash flows out as it pays its cash operating expenses (e.g., salaries and taxes, but not interest expense, which is a financing and not an operating expense).  The firm takes the cash that is left over and makes short-term net investments in working capital (e.g., inventory and receivables) and long-term investments in property, plant, and equipment.  After these actions, the cash that remains is available to pay out to the firm's investors: bondholders, and common shareholders (let's assume for the moment that the firm has not issued preferred stock).  That pile of remaining cash is called Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) because it's \"free\" to payout to the firm's investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formal definition of FCFF is the cash available to all of the firm's investors, including stockholders and bondholders, after the firm buys and sells products, provides services, pays its cash operating expenses, and makes short-term and long-term investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "When building a FCFF valuation model, one can typically choose between a single-stage, two-stage, or three stage valuation model.  The single-stage FCFF valuation model is useful for stable firms in mature industries.  Two-stage and three-stage FCFF valuation models are used when you want to model multiple phases of growth (e.g., a growth phase, a mature phase, and a transition phase).  We use a two-stage FCFF valuation model in this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "A general expression for the two-stage FCFF valuation model is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Firm\\ Value = \\sum_{t=1}^n\\overbrace{\\frac{FCFF_t}{(1 + WACC)^t}}^{Stage\\ 1}+\\overbrace{\\frac{FCFF_{n+1}}{(WACC - g)}*\\frac{1}{(1 + WACC)^n}}^{Stage\\ 2}$$<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$FCFF_t = expected\\ free\\ cash\\ flow\\ to\\ the\\ firm\\ in\\ year\\ t$<br>\n",
    "$FCFF_{n+1} = expected\\ free\\ cash\\ flow\\ to\\ the\\ firm\\ in\\ the\\ last\\ year\\ (Year\\ 6\\ in\\ this\\ example)$<br>\n",
    "$g = constant\\ expected\\ growth\\ rate\\ in\\ FCFF$<br>\n",
    "$WACC = weighted\\ average\\ cost\\ of\\ capital$<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "One common two-stage model assumes a constant growth rate in each stage, and a second common model assumes declining growth in Stage 1 followed by a long-run sustainable growth rate in Stage 2.  In our model, we assume a constant growth rate in each stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will show how to obtain each component of the two-stage FCFF valuation model, but we begin with expected FCFF which requires an ability to determine the appropriate growth rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the FCFF growth rate, we take the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of FCFF over the past three years.  This FCFF growth rate is then used to generate FCFF forecasts for each of the next 5 years, which is Stage 1 in our model. For the constant expected growth rate that will be applied to Stage 2, we divide the CAGR of FCFF by two in order to estimate the long-term growth rate of FCFF in perpetuity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calculate the FCFF growth rate and long-term growth rate, we must first acquire the FCFF from the company's financial statements.  Using the [Cash Flow Statement](https://rapidapi.com/alphawave/api/financial-statements?endpoint=apiendpoint_1cf7a51e-32f9-41a5-901a-fa4f66ba9807) and [Income Statement](https://rapidapi.com/alphawave/api/financial-statements?endpoint=apiendpoint_b4be9cff-500e-4b0a-a5a9-a8d73f9cde7a) endpoints from the [AlphaWave Data Financial Statements API](https://rapidapi.com/alphawave/api/financial-statements/endpoints), we can access the data needed to calculate FCFF.\n",
    "\n",
    "To call these APIs with Python, you can choose one of the supported Python code snippets provided in the API console. The following are examples of how to invoke the APIs with Python Requests. You will need to insert your own x-rapidapi-host and x-rapidapi-key information in the code blocks below."

    "As can be seen in this article, we were able to calculate Stock Valuation using FCFF and WACC.  In the example above, the two-stage FCFF valuation model does a reasonably good job at estimating the fair value of a company's stock price.  However, the model is very sensitive to the discount and growth rates selected.  When applying this model, it is important to consider the type of growth the company is currently experiencing along with the anticipated growth characteristics for the future. A single-stage FCFF valuation model is useful for stable firms in mature industries while two-stage and three-stage FCFF valuation models are useful when you want to model multiple phases of growth.\n",

Using the [AlphaWave Data Corporate Supply Chain API](https://rapidapi.com/alphawave/api/corporate-supply-chain/endpoints), we can get a list of suppliers and customers for a given stock symbol.  You can further filter this list of suppliers and customers using the two-stage FCFF valuation model discussed in this article to get a grouping of good pairs trading candidates that are potentially misvalued.  A list of company tickers that have supply chain data is included at the bottom of the Jupyter Notebooks available on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1e_SiiZn7WEW3OUNG-ftN3riPNjiz0M0C?usp=sharing) and [Github](https://github.com/AlphaWaveData/Jupyter-Notebooks/blob/master/AlphaWave%20Corporate%20Supply%20Chain%20API%20Example.ipynb), which could be a good list of tickers to run through the two-stage FCFF valuation model discussed above."
