## Setup and Installation

The instructions that follow assume that you run a **Docker container** or a **cloud instance** with the latest version of Ubunutu (18.10 at the time of this writing).

The execution of (parts of) the codes and Jupyter Notebooks requires enough **compute and memory resources**. Overall, it is recommended to have at least **four CPU cores and 16GB of RAM** available. The introductory examples can be executed with fewer resources.

### Cloud Instance

The following assumes that you have set up a **cloud instance** (e.g. on DigitalOcean) and have used `ssh` to login as `root`. You can then execute on the shell:

    cd /root
    wget http://hilpisch.com/nlp/setup_dna_nlp.sh
    bash setup_dna_nlp.sh

Follow the **instructions** of the script and e.g. provide a password for the Jupyter Notebook server.

After the installation, you can access the **Jupyter Notebook server** under

    http://CLOUD_IP_ADDRESS:9999

with your chosen password. Navigate via Jupyter to the code folder and open a notebook to get started.

### Docker Container

Alternatively, you can start a **Docker container** locally (with enough resources allocated). To do so e.g. execute on the shell:

    docker run -ti -h dnanlp -p 9999:9999 ubuntu:latest /bin/bash

Make sure that the container has **enough resources** allocated (e.g. via editing your Docker preferences). Then on the shell of the Docker container execute the following:

    cd root
    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade -y
    apt-get install -y wget
    wget http://hilpisch.com/nlp/setup_dna_nlp.sh
    bash setup_dna_nlp.sh

Then follow the **instructions** of the script to e.g. provide a password for the Jupyter Notebook server.

After the installation, you can access the **Jupyter Notebook server** under

    http://localhost:9999

with your chosen password. Navigate via Jupyter to the code folder and open a notebook to get started.

## Security Risks and Disclaimer

The approach chosen to run the Jupyter Notebook server is for **illustration purposes** only. There are no security measures configured beyond password protection. For example, there is no SSL encryption configured. In addition, the Jupyter Notebook server is run as `root`. As a consequence, a number of **security risks** result from the approach chosen.

All codes and Jupyter notebooks come with **no representations or warranties**, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

This repository with all its scripts, codes and Jupyter notebooks is for **illustration purposes** only.
