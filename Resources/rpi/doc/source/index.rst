Raspberry Pi for Serious Things
-------------------------------

This Web site and tutorial is about setting up and using the Raspberry Pi for some serious things. Among others, it covers so far:

* using the RPi via **SSH access** and a **fixed IP address** (:ref:`fixip`)
* using the RPi as **FTP server** (:ref:`ftp_server`)
* doing Python-based **data analytics** with the RPi (:ref:`data_analytics`)
* building and deploying **Web apps** on the RPi (:ref:`web_apps`)
* using the RPi as **Git server** (:ref:`git_server`)
* simple **Webcam surveillance** with the RPi (:ref:`webcam`)

I assume that you have bought a RPi and all the equipment necessary to use it (power plug, etc.). It is recommended to start using the RPi connected to the Web via an Ethernet cable (for convenience and speed).

Several topics and projects of this tutorial are also interesting for those not (yet) having a RPi but having available or being willing to rent a (small) **cloud server instance** e.g. from **DigitalOcean**. These start at **5 USD per month** for a 1 core, 512 MB, 20 GB SSD configuration. Just follow this link to **register**: https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=fbe512dd3dac.

The majority of examples and projects should also be working with alternative hardware like **BananaPi** (http://www.bananapi.com) or **Odroid** (cf. http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php) as long as a **Debian Linux derivative** (e.g. Raspbian, Ubuntu) is installed.
 

Setting up the RPi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step is to build a bootable SD card for the RPi. We will use a **Raspbian Debian Wheezy** operating system (OS) image in the following which you can download here: http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/.

Using a **Mac**, you can do the following to write the downloaded image to the  SD card. First, insert the SD card. On the shell type::

    diskutil list

Using **Linux** (eg Ubuntu), type::

    df -h

This gives you a list of all disk drives. Identify the SD card with a name like ``diskX``.

Then unmount the SD card on the **Mac** as follows::

    diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX

Under **Linux** do::

    umount /dev/diskX

The next step---both on Mac/Linux---is to **write the OS image** to the SD card::

    sudo dd bs=1m if=os-image.img of=/dev/diskX

Here, replace the image name and the disk name with those that apply for you.

Booting the RPi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You should connect a **monitor** via a HDMI cable to the RPi and a **keyboard** via USB (I am using a keyboard and mouse, both connected via the same USB token). Put the SD card into the RPi and connect it to the power plug. It should now **boot**.

You will be directed to an options screen where you can do different things, like for example:

* **expand the file system** to use the full capacity of your SD card (which you should do)
* **change the root/pi password** (which I assume in the following you do not do)
* **enable SSH access** (via Advanced Options, which you should do)

After finishing the options setting procedure, the RPi has to **re-boot**. Once rebooted, you should login as user ``pi`` with password ``raspberry`` (if not changed before). Then type::

    sudo apt-get update

This might take a while. After that, upgrade your system with::

    sudo apt-get upgrade

From here on, you can further use the RPi with a monitor and keyboard connected or you can use it via ``ssh`` access as one of the small projects explains.


Small Projects with the RPi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Having set up the RPi, you can now move on and implement one or more of the following smaller projects. Ideally, you should **follow them in the sequence as listed below** since later projects assume (at least to some extent) that you have successfully finished earlier ones.

The documentation is structured as follows:
